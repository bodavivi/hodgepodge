## **Introduction**:

Hodgepodge is a game based on [Century: Spice Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road/images) for 2-5 players, where players are alchemists who try to make the best mixtures in the province. For these mixtures, they need to use different ingredients.

 Each turn, players perform one of four actions:
 - Establish a marketplace (by taking a market card),
 - Make a trade or harvest ingredients (by playing a card from hand),
 - Make a mixture (by meeting a victory point card's requirements and claiming it),
 - Rest (by taking back into their hand all of the cards the player has played).
 
The last round is triggered once a player has claimed their fifth victory point card, then whoever has the most victory points wins.

For detailed rules, see [link is WIP].
